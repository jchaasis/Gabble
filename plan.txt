Use Express and Sequelize to build a social network for students. This network, called "Gabble," has users, public messages, and likes.

-Users should:
have a username and password for logging in
have a display name

-Messages should:
be associated with a user who wrote them
have up to 140 characters of text

-Likes should:
be associated with a user who made the like and a message that was liked

-The application should have ways to do the following:
Sign up as a new user
Log in
Log out
View all messages with the newest first
Create a new message
Delete one of your own messages
Like a message
See who liked a message

-This will require your knowledge of forms, validation, sessions, middleware, and Sequelize. You will likely have to look up some features of these.

**********IDEAS***********
-three different tables:
    Users, Messages, and Likes
    link them via the users and messages ids

-pages needed
    login page
    registration page
    home page
    likes page
    create message page
    app.js
    schema page for users, messages, and likes
    css
  

-get requests:
    login page
    registration page
    home page
    likes page
    create message page

-post requests:
    register
    login
    logout
    create message
    like message
    delete message

-SQL information that we will need to find:
    user
    user password

    message
    message create date
    message author
    number of likes

    author of a like
    limit like to one like per user
        (possibly boolean?)
    what message the like is tied to
    number of likes a message has


-session information
    who is logged in
    if they are the author of a message, allow the to delete that message permanently, not just for that session
    destroy the session on logout
